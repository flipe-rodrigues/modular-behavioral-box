# Modular behavioral box
Drawings for cutting all the necessary pieces for assembling a modular behavioral box for rats and mice using 5-mm-thick acrylic.

## Project structure
- **drawings/**: Contains vector graphics files for all components of the box (i.e., walls & modules).
- **media/**: Contains photos, videos & sketches illustrating some of the mechanisms and assembly steps.
- **print/**: Contains all laser-cutter-ready .pdf files.

## Parts list

- General across walls & modules:
  - 5-mm-thick acrylic;
  - acrylic glue;
  - 20-mm M3 spacers;
  - 10-mm M3 screws;
  - M3 nuts;

- Specific to poke & light modules:
  - NeoPixel 16-LED RGB rings;

## Assembly

### I. One box, one wall at a time

**1.** Print/cut the three files under [print/wall](print/wall/), each in a 435x435 mm sheet of 5-mm-thick acrylic of your chosen color for the _inner_, _middle_ and _outer_ layers of the wall (_white_, _black_ and _crystal_ in all examples below);

> missing media

**2.** Glue the three main layers of the wall together using acrylic glue;

**3.** Repeat steps 1-2 for a total of 6 walls;

> missing media

**4.** Place M3 nuts in all nut sockets of all walls;

> missing media

**5.** Screw walls together with 10-mm M3 screws;

**6.** Glue the three layers of all your modules (cutouts from step 1) together using acrylic glue. **Tip**: use a wall as gluing jig;

**7.** Print/cut the two files under [print/locks](print/locks/);

**8.** Assemble each module's four locks by putting together two _handle_ pieces (from the previous step) and a 20-mm M3 spacer;

**9.** Place all lock _feet_ inside their corresponding slots in all walls, and then insert all lock _handles_;

**10.** Populate the box with modules (i.e., place & lock them);
