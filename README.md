# Modular behavioral box
Drawings for cutting all the necessary pieces for assembling a modular behavioral box for rats and mice using 5-mm-thick acrylic.

## Project structure
- **drawings/**: Contains vector graphics files for all components of the box (i.e., walls & modules).
- **media/**: Contains photos, videos & sketches illustrating some of the mechanisms and assembly steps.
- **print/**: Contains all laser-cutter-ready .pdf files.

## Parts list

- General:
  - 5-mm-thick acrylic;
  - acrylic glue;
  - 20-mm M3 spacers;
  - 10-mm M3 screws;
  - M3 nuts;

- Specific to poke & light modules:
  - NeoPixel 16-LED RGB rings;

## Assembly

### Building one box, one wall at a time

**1.** Print/cut the three files under [print/wall](print/wall/), each in a 435x435 mm sheet of 5-mm-thick acrylic of your chosen color for the _inner_, _middle_ and _outer_ layers of the wall (_white_, _black_ and _crystal_ in all examples below);

**2.** Glue the three layers together using acrylic glue;

**3.** Repeat steps 1-2 for a total of 6 walls;

### Building two boxes in one go:
1. Print/cut the [print/two-boxes/inner.pdf](print/box/inner.pdf) file in a 3000x1520 mm sheet of 5-mm-thick acrylic of your chosen color for the inside layer of the box (**white** in the examples below);
2. Print/cut the [print/two-boxes/middle.pdf](print/box/middle.pdf) file in a 3000x1520 mm sheet of 5-mm-thick acrylic of your chosen color for the intermediate layer of the box (**black** in the examples below);
3. Print/cut the [print/two-boxes/outer.pdf](print/box/outer.pdf) file in a 3000x1520 mm sheet of 5-mm-thick acrylic of your chosen color for the outside layer of the box (**crystal** in the examples below);
